I am the program director for Carnegie Mellon - KMITL Program at CMKL University. My research interests are cloud computing, distributed systems, data visualization and emerging applications of big data platforms and connected infrastructures.

The focus of my work is on developing data platform and their supporting technologies that can collect, visualize, and make sense of data from heterogenous systems. I am interested in how we can organize and automatically integrate data from various systems ranging from enterprise databases, applications to IoT sensors in order to understand and optimize behavior of the systems. This approach can be applied to a wide range of applications from smart cities, healths, logistics, retails, food & beverage to future of services.

I have been working with various industries including service providers, logistics, finance, food & beverages and public sectors. My research goal is advancing the usage and organization of information that can support criticial decisions thru a unified platform that support data analytics and visualization.
