This course introduces students to the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems â€” computational devices and systems that integrate with physical processes for applications such as medical devices, consumer electronics, automotive systems, critical infrastructure control and robotics control. Students will learn about fundamental architecture of embedded systems. Basic topics include computer arithmetic, memory, system bus, I/O, microcontroller and microprocessor design. Students also study the interactions between computer systems and physical dynamics including interfacing with physical environments, distributed communications, real-time control, energy conservation, safety and reliability.
