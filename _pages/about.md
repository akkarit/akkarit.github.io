I am the program director for Carnegie Mellon - KMITL Program at CMKL University. My research interests are cloud computing, distributed systems, data visualization and emerging applications of big data platforms and connected infrastructures.

The focus of my work is on developing data platform and their supporting technologies that can collect, visualize, and make sense of data from heterogenous systems. I am interested in how we can organize and automatically integrate data from various systems ranging from enterprise databases, applications to IoT sensors in order to understand and optimize behavior of the systems. This approach can be applied to a wide range of applications from smart cities, healths, logistics, retails, food & beverage to future of services.

I have been working with various industries including service providers, logistics, finance, food & beverages and public sectors. My research goal is advancing the usage and organization of information that can support criticial decisions thru a unified platform that support data analytics and visualization.

Teaching

Like manddy other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
