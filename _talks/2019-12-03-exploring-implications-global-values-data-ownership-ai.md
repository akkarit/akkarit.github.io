[Workshop on AI and the Future of Stem and Societies] (https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2019/12/09-ai-workshop.html)

In this panel session in Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and the Future of STEM and Societies, the panelists seek to explore examples and how the differences in data and technology policies impact advancements in AI and automation. I introduced some of our collaborative works with various organizations over the year, both public and private sectors. I also explained how different environments and policies across different organization could impact the result and advancement of the work in AI and automation. Key success factors include support from relevant stakeholders, diversity of the work environment and commitment from team members.
